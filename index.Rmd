## About

Response diversity is variation in how organisms respond to environmental change. A diversity of responses ensures that when some organisms are negatively affected, others experience positive effects. This will lead to greater stability of ecological communities and ecosystems.

The aims of the Response Diversity Network currently include:

* To organise and accelerate scientific advances about response diversity.
* To promote the inclusion of response diversity in monitoring and assesssment of biodiversity change.
* To provide clear and accessible information about response diversity to relevant individuals, organisations, and processes.

The network should evolve and then these aims and how they are approached can evolve. The process for such change should be as open and inclusive as possible.


## Who we are

The network is open to anyone interested in being part of a community of people interested in any and all things about response diversity.

The network is currently composed of [give approximate number] researchers in fields of ecology and evolution. Greater diversity in research areas is desirable.

Current members include early career researchers (e.g. PhD candidates), researchers later in their careers, and everything in between.

Current members come from [give geographical distribution].

A steering committee helps coordinate the development of the network.
