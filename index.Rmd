# Introduction

Response diversity is variation in how organisms respond to environmental change. A diversity of responses ensures that when some organisms are negatively affected, others experience positive effects. This will lead to greater stability of ecological communities and ecosystems.

The aims of the Response Diversity Network are:

* To organise and accelerate scientific advances about response diversity.
* To promote the inclusion of response diversity in monitoring and assesssment of biodiversity change.
* To provide clear and accessible information about response diversity to relevant individuals, organisations, and processes.



# Activities

* Assembling and organising researchers working on response diversity.
* Providing a standard approach to response diversity research projects, via the [Benchmarking Response Diversity Project](https://opetchey.github.io/response_diversity_benchmarking/).
* Organising sessions at scientific meetings, and dedicated meetings and workshops.
* Hosting monthly meetings of network members.

# Services

* Providing clear and accessible lay accounts and summaries of response diversity concepts, research, and implications.
* Consultation with conservation, management, and restoration projects that wish to consider sustainability via ecological resilience and response diversity.
* Review of research proposals and reports concerning response diversity.

# Products

* Research reports, research summaries, working group reports.
